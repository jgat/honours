\noindent
The central question in combinatorial design theory is that of the existence of designs.
We use the existence question of $t$-wise balanced designs to motivate the study of decompositions of complete $t$-uniform hypergraphs into edge-disjoint copies of a given $t$-uniform hypergraph.
Building off work in \cite{baran, bryant, feng-chang2, hanani}, we solve the existence question of such decompositions for all $3$-uniform hypergraphs with at most three edges, and all regular $3$-uniform hypergraphs with four edges.

In approaching this question, we describe a general method of constructing decompositions of complete $3$-uniform hypergraphs, and present algorithms to generate solutions to small cases that are used by the construction.

We also discuss known results and conjectures in decomposing hypergraphs into Hamiltonian cycles.
