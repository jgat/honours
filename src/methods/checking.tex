\section{Checking Decompositions}

TODO. The following description is very very brief, and will be expanded.
The following method checks that a given decomposition is actually correct.

Given $3$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ and $K$, a family of sets $\{X_i\}$ of hypergraphs isomorphic to $H$, and a family of sets $\{S_i\}$ of permutations acting on $V(K)$, let
\[
    \mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{i} \bigcup_{H' \in X_i} \mathcal{O}_{\angleb{S_i}}(H'),
\]
where $\angleb{S_i}$ is the permutation group generated by $S_i$.

The following algorithm is used to verify all of the decompositions in Section \ref{section:examples}.

\begin{algorithm}
\KwIn{$3$-uniform hypergraphs $H$, $K$; the $X_i$ and $S_i$}
\KwOut{True if $\mathcal{D}$ is an $H$-decomposition of $K$, otherwise False.}

$\mathcal{D} \gets \emptyset$\;
\For{$i$}{
    $\mathcal{D}_i \gets \emptyset$\;
    \tcc{Note that as more elements get added to $\mathcal{D}_i$, the following loop will then loop over those elements. This is what causes successive powers of each $\pi \in S_i$ to be included.}
    \For{$H' \in \mathcal{D}_i$}{
        \For{$\pi \in S_i$}{
            $\mathcal{D}_i \gets \mathcal{D}_i \cup \{\pi(H')\}$\;
        }
    }
    $\mathcal{D} \gets \mathcal{D} \cup \mathcal{D}_i$\;
}

$E = \emptyset$\;
\For{$H' \in \mathcal{D}$}{
    $E \gets E \cup E(H')$\;
}

\uIf{$E = E(K)$}{
    \KwRet{True}\;
} \uElse {
    \KwRet{False}\;
}
