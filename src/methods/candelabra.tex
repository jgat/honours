\section{Decompositions of $L_{v,v,[w]}^{(3)}$}
\label{sec:methods/candelabra}

TODO. Outline:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the structure of the decomposition: $U = \{u_i \mid i \in \Z_u\}$, $V = \{v_i \mid i \in \Z_u\}$, $W = \{\infty_1, \ldots, \infty_w\}$, where $u = |U| = |V|$ and $w = |W|$. Orbits under the action of $\Z_u$ and $\infty_k \mapsto \infty_k$.
    \item Describe the `orbit types': $\{u_i, v_{i+d}, \infty_k\} \leftrightarrow (\infty_a, d)$; $\{v_i, u_{i+a}, u_{i+b}\} \leftrightarrow (u, a, b)$; $\{u_i, v_{i+a}, v_{i+b}\} \leftrightarrow (v, a, b)$
    \item Give analogues of Algorithm 3.1 and 3.2. Would I need to redefine `admissible' sets of orbits (cf. Definition 3.2.2)? The definition would be identical, except that $K_{v}^{(3)}$ would be replaced with $L_{U,V}^{(3)} \cup K_{U,V,W}^{(3)}$.

    The analogue of algorithm 3.3 is practically identical that it's probably not worth including (I'd simply state that the algorithm is analagous to Algorithm 3.3). Another option would be to tweak the content of Algorithm 3.3 to apply in the general case - i.e. instead of finding decompositions of $K_{v}^{(3)}$, change the wording so that it takes an arbitrary hypergraph $K$.
\end{itemize}
