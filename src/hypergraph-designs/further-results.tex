\section{Further results}

In \cite{feng-chang2}, the authors consider a copy of $K_4^{(3)}$ with an edge removed, denoted by $K_4^{(3)} - e$, and in \cite{feng-chang}, the authors consider the graph denoted $K_4^{(3)} + e$, with vertex set $V = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and edges \[E = \{\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\},\{3,4,5\}\}:\]

\begin{theorem}[\cite{feng-chang}]
A $(K_4^{(3)}+e)$-design of order $v$ exists iff $v \equiv 0,1,2$ (mod $5$) and $v \neq 5$.
\end{theorem}
