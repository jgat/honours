\section{Further results}

In \cite{feng-chang2}, the authors consider a copy of $K_4^{(3)}$ with an edge removed, denoted by $K_4^{(3)} - e$, and in \cite{feng-chang}, the authors consider the graph denoted $K_4^{(3)} + e$, with vertex set $V = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and edges \[E = \{\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\},\{3,4,5\}\}:\]

\begin{theorem}[\cite{feng-chang}]
A $(K_4^{(3)}+e)$-design of order $v$ exists iff $v \equiv 0$, $1$, or $2$ (mod $5$) and $v \neq 5$.
\end{theorem}

In \cite{keevash}, Keevash considers $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decompositions of an arbitrary $t$-uniform hypergraph $H$, and gives the following result.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash}]
Let $H$ be a $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, and let $k \geq t$ be an integer such that $K_{k}^{(t)}$ satisfies
the conditions of Lemma \ref{obv-necessary-1} for the existence of a $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decomposition of $H$.

Suppose that $c$ is a positive real number, and $d, h$ are positive integers such that $\frac{1}{n} \ll c \ll d$, $\frac{1}{h} \ll \frac{1}{k}$, and $|E(H)| > dn^t$. Suppose also that there exists some real number $p > 0$ such that for any collection $\mathcal{A}$ of $(t-1)$-element subsets of $V(H)$ with $|\mathcal{A}| \leq h$,
\[
    \left| \left\{ x \in V(H) : \forall S \in \mathcal{A}, S \cup \{x\} \in E(H) \right\} \right| = (1 \pm c) p^{|\mathcal{A}|} n.
\]
Then there exists an $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decomposition of $H$.
\end{theorem}

Informally, this result states that if $H$ contains sufficiently many edges and satisfies certain connectedness conditions, then the conditions of Lemma \ref{obv-necessary-1} are also sufficient for the existence of a $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decomposition of $H$.

If we take $H = K_{v}^{(t)}$, then we have as an immediate corollary that for sufficiently large $v$, there exists an $S(t, k, v)$ Steiner system.
