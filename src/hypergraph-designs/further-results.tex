\section{Further results}

In \cite{feng-chang2}, the authors consider a copy of $K_4^{(3)}$ with an edge removed, denoted by $K_4^{(3)} - e$, and in \cite{feng-chang}, the authors consider the graph denoted $K_4^{(3)} + e$, with vertex set $V = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and edges \[E = \{\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{2,3,4\},\{3,4,5\}\}:\]

\begin{theorem}[\cite{feng-chang}]
A $(K_4^{(3)}+e)$-design of order $v$ exists iff $v \equiv 0,1,2$ (mod $5$) and $v \neq 5$.
\end{theorem}

TODO: discuss Keevash's result (I also need to fill in the ``sufficient'' bit into more
formal words):
\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{keevash}]
Let $H$ be a $t$-uniform hypergraph, and suppose that $K_{k}^{(t)}$ satisfies
the conditions of Lemma \ref{obv-necessary-1} for a $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decomposition
of $H$. For ``sufficient'' $H$, there exists an $K_{k}^{(t)}$-decomposition of $H$.
\end{theorem}

If we take $H = K_{v}^{(t)}$, then a $t$-$(v, k, 1)$ design exists for sufficiently large $v$.
