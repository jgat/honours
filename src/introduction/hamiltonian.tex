\section{Hamiltonian decompositions}

Various attempts have been made to generalise the well-known result of Walecki
from the 1890's that $K_v$ admits a Hamiltonian decomposition if and only if
$v$ is odd, and a decomposition into Hamiltonian cycles plus a 1-factor if and
only if $v$ is even, we shall discuss them here.

First, it must be made clear what is meant by a Hamiltonian cycle of a
hypergraph, and particularly, of $K_v^{(t)}$. The following definition,
given by Berge in \cite{berge}, extends naturally from the definition of a
Hamiltonian cycle on a graph:

\begin{definition}
Let $H$ be a hypergraph containing $v$ vertices, with vertex set
$V(H) = \{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}\}$. A {\em Berge type Hamiltonian cycle}
in $H$ is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges $(x_0, e_0, x_1, e_1,
\ldots, x_{v-1}, e_{v-1}, x_0)$ where $x_i \neq x_j$ if $i \neq j$, and such
that $e_i \in E(H)$ contains $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$ for each $i = 0,1,\ldots,v-1$
(modulo $v$).
\qed
\end{definition}

A decomposition of a hypergraph $H$ into Berge type Hamiltonian cycles is called
a {\em Berge type Hamiltonian decomposition}.

In 2-uniform graphs, one can drop the edges from the sequence and consider only the
sequence of vertices, note that this cannot be done here.

The existence problem for Hamiltonian decompositions of Berge type for
$K_{v}^{(3)}$ was solved in \cite{verall}, completing work in \cite{bermond-al}:

\begin{theorem} \label{berge-hamilton}
A Berge type Hamiltonian decomposition of $K_v^{(3)}$ exists iff $v
\equiv 1$ or $2$ (mod $3$); and if $v \equiv 0$ (mod 3), there exists a
Berge type Hamiltonian decomposition of $K_v^{(3)} - T$, where $T$ is a
1-factor of $H$.
\end{theorem}

Since $K_v^{(t)}$ has $v \choose t$ edges, and a (Berge type) Hamiltonian cycle
contains $v$ edges, we must have $v \mid {v \choose t}$ for a Hamiltonian
decomposition of $K_v^{(t)}$ to exist. In \cite{bermond}, the authors conjecture
that this obvious necessary condition is sufficient for all $v$ and $t$, and in
\cite{kuhn-osthus}, the authors prove this for $v \geq 30$:

\begin{theorem} \label{berge-hamilton2}
Suppose that $v \geq 30$, $4 \leq t < v$, and that $v \mid {v \choose t}$. Then
$K_v^{(t)}$ has a Berge type Hamiltonian decomposition.
\end{theorem}

This is a clear analogue of Walecki's result for 2-uniform (hyper)graphs.
Hence, the problem remains open for $4 \leq t < n < 30$.

A stronger definition for a Hamiltonian cycle of a $t$-uniform hypergraph $H$ of
order $v$ is given by Katona and Kierstead in \cite{kato-kier}:

\begin{definition}
Let $H$ be a $t$-uniform hypergraph of order $v$, and suppose that $V(H) =
\{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{v-1}\}$.
A {\em Katona-Kierstead type Hamiltonian cycle} in $H$ is a cyclic ordering
$(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{v-1})$ of $V(H)$
such that $\{x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_{i+t-1}\} \in E(H)$ for each $i =
0,1,\ldots,v-1$ (modulo $v$).
\qed
\end{definition}

The authors define paths and cycles on a $t$-uniform hypergraph in the same
manner.
A Katona-Kierstead type Hamiltonian decomposition of $H$ is a decomposition of
$H$ into Katona-Kierstead type Hamiltonian cycles.

In \cite{bail-stev}, the authors conjecture that the obvious necessary
condition is also sufficient for Katona-Kierstead Hamiltonian decompositions:

\begin{conjecture} \label{bailey-stevens} (\cite{bail-stev})
For $v \geq 5$ and $2 \leq t \leq v-2$, there exists a Katona-Kierstead type
Hamiltonian decomposition of $K_{v}^{(t)}$ iff $v \mid {v \choose t}$.
\end{conjecture}

The conjecture has been solved for $t = 2$ by Walecki, for $t=3$ with $v \leq
32$, and for $(v, t) \in \{(9,4),(13,4)\}$, in \cite{bail-stev} and
\cite{mesz-rosa}, as well as the equivalent cases with $t' = v-t$, but
the conjecture otherwise remains open.

The following are also open conjectures about Hamiltonian decompositions of
Katona-Kierstead type, which are discussed in \cite{mesz-rosa} and
\cite{kuhl-schr}:

\begin{conjecture} (\cite{mesz-rosa})
For all $v \equiv 0$ (mod $3$), there exists a Katona-Kierstead type
Hamiltonian decomposition of $K_v^{(3)} - T$, where $T$ is a 1-factor.
\end{conjecture}

The authors also establish this conjecture for $v \leq 12$. This conjecture is a
clear analogue of Theorem \ref{berge-hamilton}, and of Walecki's result. The
following conjecture extends the Bailey-Stevens conjecture (Conjecture
\ref{bailey-stevens}) to complete $3$-uniform multihypergraphs of index $\lambda$:

\begin{conjecture} (\cite{mesz-rosa})
For $v \geq 4$, a (Katona-Kierstead type) Hamiltonian decomposition of
$\lambda K_v^{(3)}$ exists iff $\lambda \equiv 0$ (mod $3$) or $v \equiv 1, 2$
(mod $3$) when $\lambda \equiv 1,2$ (mod $3$).
\end{conjecture}

The following conjecture considers an analogue of
Hamiltonian decompositions of bipartite graphs, whereby $K_{v,v}$ has a
Hamiltonian decomposition iff $v$ is even, and $K_{v,v} - T$ has a
decomposition iff $v$ is odd, where $T$ is a 1-factor:

\begin{conjecture} (\cite{kuhl-schr})
For $v, t \geq 2$, the complete $t$-uniform $t$-partite hypergraph
$K_{t[v]}^{(t)}$ has a (Katona-Kierstead type) Hamiltonian decomposition iff
$t \mid v^{t-1}$.
\end{conjecture}

The authors also show this conjecture holds for $t = 4$ and $t \mid v$, and
also show that $K_{3[v]}^{(3)} - T$ has a Hamiltonian decomposition
whenever $3 \nmid v$ and $v \neq 4$.
