\noindent
To my supervisor, Barbara Maenhaut, thanks for all of the time and effort you've put into having me as a student.
I appreciated the time set aside for meetings, reading drafts, tolerating my inability to meet my own goals, and giving support in all other aspects of my honours year.

To the 2014 mathematics honours cohort, thanks for the ride. It would have been much less interesting year without you.

To my family and friends, thanks for putting up with my attempts to tell you how interesting my studies are, especially after you'd already given up trying to understand.

To the {\sc Lord} God, who created all things, I owe everything that I am.
I praise God for the ability and opportunity to study and understand His creation, without which this work would not be possible.
As I have increasingly learned to consider all things as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, I present this work with the hope that by it, I might proclaim His glory.
